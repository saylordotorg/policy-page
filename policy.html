        <h4>What should I know before I start?</h4>
        <p>Saylor Academy courses are made by college professors. These courses are similar to courses found in a traditional college and it can take a long time to read everything in the course. The average time is 100 hours. You can work faster or slower. Work at a speed that is comfortable for you.</p>
        <p>You can earn a free certificate of completion for each course. A course is completed when you take the final exam, called “Final Exam”, and get a grade of 70% or higher. You do not need to complete all activities in the course and you may not need to read all of the material. We suggest that you take the unit quizzes for practice.</p>
        <p>Some courses also have a college credit recommendation. These courses will have a second final exam called “Saylor Direct Credit Final Exam”. You must take this exam with a proctor. Your proctor will have a password to access the exam. Read more about our Saylor Direct credit pathways <a href="https://www.saylor.org/credit">here</a>.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>How do I start?</h4>
        <p>After you confirm your account, you can look through the course catalog. When you find a course you like, click the course title. You will see a button at the top of the screen that says “Enroll me in this course”. Click this button and follow the instructions.</p>
        <p>After you enroll in the course, go back to the course and read the “Course Syllabus” in the course introduction. Pay attention to the learning outcomes for the course.</p>
        <p>Next, go to Unit 1 and read the learning outcomes for this unit. Click the first sub-unit, “1.1”, and read through the material. Continue through the sub-units in the same way and take the Unit 1 Assessment. Complete the next units in the same way.</p>
        <br><p>Good luck!</p>
